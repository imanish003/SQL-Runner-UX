# Ideation ðŸ’¡

This document captures the ideation step of the design thinking process for the SQL Runner UX Challenge. The goal is to think of all features I feel would be useful for the users of this application. The idea is to first start thinking about essential and crucial features, and then move on to more advanced and nice-to-have features. I will try to list down as many features as I can think of, without worrying about the feasibility or complexity of implementing them. Later, we can prioritize these features based on their importance and feasibility.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Assumption: A data analyst is going to use this application frequently to run SQL queries against a database and analyze the results.

## Core Features (Must-Have)

These are the must-have features that are crucial for the basic functionality of the SQL Runner application.

### Functional Features

1. **Query Input Area**: A text area where users can write and edit their SQL queries. This could be as simple as a plain text box or a more advanced code editor.

2. **Execute Button**: A button to run the SQL query against the connected database to fetch results.

3. **Results Display**: A section to display the results of the executed query in a tabular format.

4. **Saved Queries**: It could be considered as an essential feature to allow users to save frequently used queries for quick access. It doesn't make sense for analysts to rewrite the same query every time they need to run it.

### Non-Functional Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The application should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This is important as analysts may need to access the application from various devices. In modern web development, it's expected that applications are responsive. Also, this ensures that we are building responsive from the start, rather than trying to refactor it later.

2. **Performance**: The application should be optimized for performance to ensure quick loading times and smooth interactions, especially when dealing with large datasets.

3. **Accessibility**: The application should follow accessibility best practices to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities. This is not only required from a legal standpoint but also ensures that we are building an inclusive product. Accessibility also helps in writing cleaner code and improves overall user experience. By default, we must use semantic HTML elements and ARIA roles where necessary.

4. **Security**: Implement basic security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities, such as XSS and CSRF attacks. This is important to ensure that user data and queries are protected from malicious activities.

5. Various other UX improvements like distinct areas for input and output, loading indicators when a query is being executed, error messages when a query fails, etc.

## Enhanced and Advanced Features

These features enhance the user experience and provide additional functionality. It would be great to have these features, but the application can function without them.This is an exhaustive list of features that can be considered for a SQL Runner application. We will need to prioritize these features based on user needs and implementation complexity.

### Query Input field Enhancements

Here, main enhancement would be to replace the plain text area with a more advanced code editor like Monaco or CodeMirror. This should be easy to implement as there are existing libraries for this. Here are some features I would like to see in the code editor:

1. **Syntax Highlighting**: Implement syntax highlighting for SQL keywords, functions, and operators to improve readability.
2. **Auto-Completion**: Provide auto-completion suggestions for SQL keywords, table names, and column names as users type their queries.
3. **Query Formatting**: Add a feature to format SQL queries for better readability. Probably a button named "Format Query" that users can click to format their SQL queries.
4. **Line Numbers**: Display line numbers in the code editor to help users navigate their queries more easily.
5. **Find and Replace**: Implement a find and replace feature to allow users to quickly search for specific text within their queries and replace it if needed.
6. **Code Folding**: Allow users to collapse and expand sections of their SQL queries for better organization and readability.
7. **Error Highlighting**: Highlight syntax errors in the SQL query to help users identify. This way they can correct them before executing the query.

### Results Display Enhancements

Analyst would expect various features which are common for tabular data display. Here are some features I would like to see in the results display section:

1. **Sorting**: Allow users to sort the results by clicking on column headers.
2. **Filtering**: Provide filtering options to allow users to filter results based on specific criteria. We can add a filter icon next to each column header that users can click to open a filter dialog.
3. **Server Side Pagination**: If the result set is large, then client side pagination won't be efficient. Ideally, we should implement server side pagination to fetch one page at a time. This also applies to Infinite Scrolling.
4. **Export Options**: Provide options to export the results in various formats such as CSV, Excel, or JSON. Analysts generally like to export data for further analysis in other tools.
5. **Query Metadata**: Display metadata about the executed query, such as execution time, total number of rows returned, etc.
6. **Column Resizing**: Allow users to resize columns by dragging the edges of column headers. This will help users to adjust the column width as per their requirement and improve readability.
7. **Chart Generation**: Provide an option to generate charts (like bar, line, pie charts) from the result set for better visualization and analysis. This is especially useful for analysts who want to quickly visualize data trends.

### Query Management

We should provide various features to manage queries effectively. Here are some features I would like to see in the query management section, probably in a collapsible sidebar.

1. **Query History**: Maintain a history of executed queries so users can easily access and re-run previous queries.
2. **Saved and Favorite Queries**: Allow users to save and mark frequently used queries as favorites for quick access.
3. **Query Folders/Organization**: Provide a way to organize saved queries into folders or categories for better management. Maybe also allowing tags for queries.
4. **Query Templates**: Allow users to create and use query templates for common query patterns. This will save time for analysts.
5. **Tabbed Results View**: Allow users to open multiple query results in separate tabs for easy comparison and analysis. This is very useful when an analyst is working with multiple queries at the same time. This could be as advance as Google Chrome's tabs system which allow grouping of tabs, pinning tabs, etc.
6. **Query Sharing**: Allow users to share saved queries with other users or teams for collaboration. Probably creating a shareable link for the query is a good idea. In case of teams, probably creating a shareable folder is a good idea.
7. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature to allow users to quickly find saved queries by name or content.

### UX Improvements

1. **Copy to Clipboard**: Add a button to copy the executed query to the clipboard for easy sharing or reuse.
2. **Undo/Redo**: Implement undo and redo functionality in the query input area to allow users to revert changes easily.
3. **Auto-Save Drafts**: Automatically save query drafts at regular intervals to prevent data loss.
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear and informative error messages when a query fails to execute, including suggestions for resolving common issues.
5. **Dark Mode**: Provide a dark mode option for users who prefer a darker interface.
6. **Full Screen Mode**: Allow users to toggle a full-screen mode for the query input area and results display for better focus and usability. This way, users can focus on writing queries or analyzing results without distractions. This is especially useful for users working on smaller screens or results with too many columns.
7. **Resizable Panels**: Allow users to resize the query input area and results display area by dragging the divider between them. This will help users to allocate more space to either section based on their current task.

### Collaboration Features

1. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on writing and editing SQL queries in real-time, similar to Google Docs. This is useful for teams working together on data analysis.
2. **Comments and Annotations**: Allow users to add comments or annotations to specific parts
3. **Team Workspaces**: Provide team workspaces where users can share queries, results, and collaborate on data analysis projects.
4. **Query Documentation**: Allow users to add documentation or notes to saved queries to explain their purpose and usage. This is useful for teams to understand the context of shared queries.
5. **Activity Log**: Maintain an activity log to track changes made to queries, including who made the changes and when.

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Large Dataset Handling**: Implement optimizations for handling large datasets.

- Server side pagination to fetch one page at a time.
- If implementing infinite scrolling, then along with server side pagination, we should implement Virtualization (rendering only the rows that are visible in the viewport) to improve performance. Libraries like `@tanstack/react-virtual` with `@tanstack/react-table` can be used for this purpose.

2. **Query Caching**: Implement caching for frequently executed queries to improve performance and reduce load on the database. This caching can be done at various levels - in-memory caching, local storage caching, or even using a dedicated caching layer like Redis.
3. **Query Cancellation**: Provide an option to cancel long-running queries to prevent users from waiting indefinitely. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets or complex queries that may take a long time to execute.
4. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for components and data to improve initial load times and overall performance.

Apart from above, all performance improvements should be done at various levels like Build tools optimizations, bundling, minification, image optimizations, etc. We should always measure performance using tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

### Enterprise Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement role-based access control to manage user permissions and restrict access to certain features based on user roles. This is important for enterprise applications where different users may have different levels of access.
2. **Audit Trail**: Maintain audit logs to track user activities, including query executions, changes to saved queries, and other significant actions. This is important for compliance and security purposes.
3. **Data Masking**: Implement data masking techniques to protect sensitive data in query results, especially when dealing with personally identifiable information.
4. **Email Notifications**: Allow users to set up email notifications for specific events, such as query execution completion or errors. This is useful for users who want to be notified when a long-running query finishes.
5. **Webhooks Integration**: Allow users to set up webhooks to trigger external actions based on specific events, such as query execution or data updates. This is useful for integrating with other systems and automating workflows.

### Other Enhancements

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions like executing a query (e.g., Ctrl+Enter), saving a query (e.g., Ctrl+S), and opening the saved queries panel (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+S). This will enhance productivity for power users who prefer using the keyboard over the mouse. Probably also allowing users to customize these shortcuts as per their preference.
2. **Database Schema Explorer**: This will allow users to browse the database schema, including tables, columns, and relationships. This will help users to understand the database structure and write queries more efficiently.
3. **Multi-Database Support**: Allow users to connect to and switch between multiple databases within the application. This is useful for analysts who work with different databases. This includes adding a database connection manager to manage multiple database connections. There should be UI to switch between different database connections easily. Probably, it would be good idea to show this switcher at per query level, so that user can change the database for each query if needed, probably near the Execute button.
4. **Query Execution Plans**: Provide an option to view the execution plan of a query to help users understand how the database engine processes the query. This is useful for performance tuning and optimization.
5. **Visual SQL Query Builder**: Provide a visual SQL query builder for users who may not be proficient in writing SQL queries. This can help users to construct queries using a drag-and-drop interface, making it easier for non-technical users to interact with the database. But considering that this is for data analysts, this may not be a very high priority feature.
