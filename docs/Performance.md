# Performance Metrics

I have used both Performance Tab of Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse to measure the performance of the application. You can see below the results from both tools. Apart from these, I have also checked using PageSpeed Insights and WebPageTest, and the results are similar to what you see below.

## Performance Tab of Chrome DevTools

I have used Performance Tab of Chrome DevTools to measure the performance of the application. Here are some key metrics:

- Time to First Byte (TTFB): ~50ms
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): ~250ms
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): ~380 ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): ~0.00

## Lighthouse Performance Score

Here is screenshot of the Lighthouse performance score. It shows both Performance and Accessibility scores are 100.
